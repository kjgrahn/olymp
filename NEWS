olymp 2.3 (2008-07-25):
 - Tolerate lowercase dscnnnnnn.jpg, too.

olymp 2.2 (2007-12-26):
 - Tolerate DSCnnnnnn.JPG names too. At least Sony cameras produce those.

olymp 2.1 (2007-07-02):

  - Accept uppercase file names (e.g. P6250013.JPG, not only
    p6250013.jpg).  Files which have passed via a Windows machine may
    have been uppercased.  Hell, maybe you /run/ olymp on a Windows
    machine -- there is nothing Unix-specific about it.

olymp 2.0 (2006-02-05):
  - First public release.
  - Completely rewritten (in Python). Now uses the EXIF information
    rather than file names and file modification dates, except the
    image serial number still comes from the file name.
