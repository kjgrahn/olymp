.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.
Olympus cameras (at least the Camedia C-7x0 UZ series)
store images in files with pretty silly names, like
.BR P7050124.JPG .
This translates to
\[lq]the current year,
month 7,
day 05,
image serial number 0124\[rq].
Stored inside the image, as
.SM EXIF
data, is the full date, along with the time of day.
.LP
This utility prints a more readable variation of the file name,
along with the date and time, based on the
.SM EXIF
information.
Optionally, if the
.B \-e
option is given,
the file is renamed in the same fashion.
.LP
The generated file names look like
.BR 2005-07-06_0018.jpg .
This assures that they sort correctly in e.g. directory listings,
and guarantee their uniqueness (at least if you only use one camera on
any particular day).
.
.PP
Other digital cameras use some kind of fixed prefix,
followed by an image serial number.
The only useful part of the file name is this serial number \- which
seems to exist only here, not in the EXIF information.
Thus this utility correctly handles the following naming conventions:
.
.IP "\fBP\fImddserial\fP.JPG" 25x
Olympus
.IP "\fBDSC\fIserial\fP.JPG"
Various camera makers.
.IP "\fBDSCN\fIserial\fP.JPG"
At least Nikon (is the
.B N
for Nikon, perhaps?)
.IP "\fIyyyy-mm-dd_serial\fB.JPG"
its own format
.
.SH "NOTES"
.
.IP \- 2m
Renaming (with the
.B \-e
option) is always safe.
Existing files are never overwritten, and files which are already
correctly named aren't touched at all.
.
.IP \-
.B olymp
does not use the time stamp of the file.
Nor does it use the current file name, except for the image serial number.
.
.IP \-
All this assumes you
.I do
have a correctly set internal clock in your camera.
Without it,
.B olymp
cannot do anything useful to the images.
.
.SH "BUGS"
.
The way dates are read in the image file's
.SM EXIF
information is not very elegant.
.B olymp
may fail to find certain dates,
or may pick e.g. the last-edited date instead of
the date the picture was taken.
