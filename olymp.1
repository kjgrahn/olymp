.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.
Digital cameras
store images in files with pretty silly names, like
.BR P7050124.JPG .
This translates to
\[lq]the current year,
month 7,
day 05,
image serial number 0124\[rq].
Stored inside the image, as
.SM EXIF
data, is the full date, along with the time of day.
.LP
This utility prints a more readable variation of the file name,
along with the date and time and possibly a GPS coordinate, based on the
.SM EXIF
information.
Optionally, if the
.B \-e
option is given,
the file is renamed in the same fashion.
.LP
An output entry may look like:
.IP
.ft CW
.nf
2019-10-19_0074.jpg   \fInew filename, with no directory part\fP
2019-10-19 14:56      \fPdate and time\fP
.fi
.LP
The new file name assures that it sorts correctly in e.g. directory listings,
and guarantees uniqueness (at least if you only use one camera on
any particular day).
.PP
The date and time come, as noted, from the
.SM EXIF
information, i.e. from the camera's clock.
So the clock has to be set correctly for this information to be useful.
The time recorded in the file is
.I local
time \- with no timezone information \- so that's what's printed here, too.
For most purposes, that's acceptable.
.
.SS "GPS coordinates"
.
If the image is geotagged, i.e. contains Exif/GPS information from a
GPS receiver or similar, the camera's coordinate is also included in the output.
For example:
.IP
.ft CW
.nf
2018-07-24_2482.jpg
2018-07-24 06:33
{65.6542 14.5360}
.fi
.LP
This is a
.SM "\fBWGS\ 84"
coordinate, in degrees, rounded to four decimals.
It's printed this way irrespectively of the format used in the photo.
The various error estimates which may or may not be encoded into
the photo are also ignored \- so it's up to the reader to remember that
there's an uncertainty involved.
.
.SS "Input file names"
.
All digital cameras I've seen encode an image serial number into the file name,
after some kind of prefix.
The only useful part of the file name is this serial number \- which
seems to exist only here, not in the EXIF information.
.PP
Thus this utility correctly handles the following naming conventions,
in upper- or lowercase:
.
.IP "\fBP\fImddserial\fP.JPG" 25x
Olympus, Panasonic; others?
.IP "\fBDSC\fIserial\fP.JPG"
Various camera makers.
.IP "\fBDSCN\fIserial\fP.JPG"
At least Nikon (is the
.B N
for Nikon, perhaps?)
.IP "\fBIMAG\fIserial\fP.JPG"
At least some camera-equipped phones
.IP "\fIyyyy-mm-dd_serial\fB.JPG"
its own format
.
.PP
Some of these naming conventions are probably standardized.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.BP \-e
Perform actual renaming of files; don't just list new names.
.IP
Renaming is always safe.
Existing files are never overwritten, and files which are already
correctly named aren't touched at all.
.
.SH "NOTES"
.
.B Olymp
does not use the time stamp of the file.
Nor does it use the current file name, except for the image serial number.
.
.SH "BUGS"
.
.B Olymp
can currently only handle images where the Exif information is encoded as
.I little-endian
TIFF, not big-endian.  I've never encountered the latter variant.
.PP
When an image contains GPS data, chances are it also contains an accurate
GPS timestamp.
.B Olymp
doesn't use it, and doesn't warn if the camera's clock disagrees with it.
.PP
If the photo is taken in Sweden,
the WGS 84 coordinate should be converted to
.SM "\fBSWEREF\ 99"
because the latter is more human-readable;
for example you can estimate distances between two coordinates.
