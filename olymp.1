.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.
Olympus cameras (at least the Camedia C-7x0 UZ series)
store images in files with pretty silly names, like
.BR p7050124.jpg .
This translates to
\[lq]the current year,
month 7,
day 05,
image serial number 0124\[rq].
Stored inside the image, as
.SM EXIF
data, is the full date, along with the time of day.
.LP
This utility prints a more readable variation of the file name,
along with the date and time, based on the
.SM EXIF
information.
Optionally, if the
.B \-e
option is given,
the file is renamed in the same fashion.
.LP
The generated file names look like
.BR 2005-07-06_0018.jpg .
This assures that they sort correctly in e.g. directory listing.
.
.SH "NOTES"
.
.IP \- 3n
Actually,
.B olymp
should work with any digital camera, as long as the file names it creates
contain a four-digit image serial number.
Haven't tried it, though.
.
.IP \-
Renaming (with the
.B \-e
option) is always safe.
Existing files are never overwritten, and files which are already
correctly named aren't touched at all.
.
.IP \-
.B olymp
does not use the time stamp of the file.
Nor does it use the current file name, except for the image serial number
(which apparently only exists in the file name, not in the
.SM EXIF
data).
.
.IP \-
All this assumes you
.I do
have a correctly set internal clock in your camera.
Without it,
.B olymp
cannot do anything useful to the images.
.
.SH "BUGS"
.
The way dates are read in the image file's
.SM EXIF
information is not very elegant.
.B olymp
may fail to find certain dates,
or may pick e.g. the last-edited date instead of
the date the picture was taken.
